The topic of the work concerns the design and implementation of an online application that allows the management of courses as well as the management of the scores of these courses. Also, this application should be able to generate various kinds of statistics from the scores. The application will be able to be used both by the professors of a university department and by its students. In addition, it will also be available to anonymous visitors.
